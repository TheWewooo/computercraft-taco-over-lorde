this is a project that i hope to expand(expand is a funny word) and publish when it reaches a point where I would call it "acceptable" (if i can keep motivated to even get it there xD)
not much in the readme right now as the project just started but this is aimed towards computercraft for mc 1.6.4
w/ lua 1.6+ support to port it to future versions

this is in ALPHA STATE as it's currently being developed so any damage to your world, etc I take no responsibility. 
with that said, i would apprieciate a DETAILED report for any errors of bugs occured

sooo horay you made it to the end of this poop readme(if you read the whole thing i'll send you a taco)

taco license 2017 no stealy donut steel
